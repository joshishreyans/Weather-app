# Weather app
This is an app to find the current weather of a city.
To make this app working you just need to create an account on https://openweathermap.org and obtain the API key from My API keys section.
The website might take a few minutes to initialize your API key after making your account.
Once you have obtained the API key replace the YOUR_API_KEY with the key inside index.html and index.js.
